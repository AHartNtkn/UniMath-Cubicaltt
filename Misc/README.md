# Misc UniMath-Cubicaltt
This is an assortment of files made by me (AHartNtkn), not directly related to Unimath, but might be worth keeping for the future.

Note that these files are dependent on the standard CubicalTT library, NOT Unimath

This contains;

vectors.ctt : Two different implementations of vectors, and a proof that they are equivalent.

cantor.ctt : A proof of cantors theorem, that nat is strictly smaller than nat -> bool.

paths.ctt : Two different implementations of the type of all paths, and a proof that they are equivalent.
