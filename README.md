# UniMath-Cubicaltt
This is a port of the UniMath library into the Cubicaltt language.

The main reason I'm doing this is to get a better understanding of UniMath, and by extension mathematics as a whole, and Univalence in particular. In addition, this gives me good practice in Cubicaltt, which should transfer somewhat to other higher-categorical languages which I anticipate to exist in the future.
